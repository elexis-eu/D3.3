This package contains a software whose function is to 
automatically tag dictionary glosses with domains of knowledge 
labels. 

The software exploits the representational power of 
multilingual BERT (M-BERT) and makes use of a simple yet 
efficient Sequence Classification architecture, composed of a 
multilingual BERT encoder -- which encodes the input -- and a 
linear layer, to perform the classification.
